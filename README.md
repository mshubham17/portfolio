# Shubham Mehta | Portfolio

A modern portfolio built to reflect how I think about design, structure, and user experience.

This is my personal portfolio, a space where I document my growth as a developer and share the projects I’ve been building along the way.
Every section reflects something I’ve learned  from layout decisions to theme architecture and UI polish.

This portfolio will evolve as I do.
